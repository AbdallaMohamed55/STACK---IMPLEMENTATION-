# STACK---IMPLEMENTATION-
To Study and Implement Stack Implementation Using Array with Menu Options (Push, Pop, Display, Exit)

# Aim 

To study the concept of stacks and implement basic stack operations — Push, Pop, and Display — using arrays in C++.

# Theory

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, meaning the element that is inserted last is the first to be removed.
It can be implemented using either arrays or linked lists.

## Basic Stack Operations:

  1. Push: Insert an element at the top of the stack.
 
  2. Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.

  3. Display: Show all elements in the stack from top to bottom.

## Conditions:

   * Overflow: Trying to push an element into a full stack.

   * Underflow: Trying to pop an element from an empty stack.

## Applications of Stack:

   * Expression evaluation and conversion (infix, postfix, prefix)

   * Function call management (recursion)

   * Undo/Redo operations

   * Syntax parsing and backtracking algorithms


## Procedure:

    i/Open a C++ compiler and create a new file.

    ii/ Write the above code and save it as stack_array.cpp.

    iii/ Compile the code to remove syntax errors.

    iv/ Run the program.
  
    v/ Test by choosing different menu options (Push, Pop, Display).

    vi/ Observe the stack operations and output.


# Conclusion 

The experiment demonstrates the LIFO behavior of the stack data structure using array implementation. The menu-driven program helps visualize stack operations, and the concept can be extended to dynamic implementations using linked lists.
